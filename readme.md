# Brooklyn Shows Love Resources

A directory of civic resources for New Yorkers who need help. 

![BSL in action](https://mattseidholz.com/assets/images/bsl-resources.gif)

Derived by data from the [Brooklyn Shows Love](http://www.equalityforflatbush.org/brooklyn-shows-love-mutual-aid-project/) crew.

## Rationale

### Why make this?

[Brooklyn Shows Love](http://www.equalityforflatbush.org/brooklyn-shows-love-mutual-aid-project/) is an amazing organization. 

Staffed entirely by volunteers, funded entirely by donations, BSL feeds, supplies, and advocates for thousands of community members every year.

A big part of their work is running a resource hotline, which connects community members to resources that could be helpful.

But what do hotline workers use to find resources?

A **40 page Google doc.**

I thought that was a little cumbersome, so I whipped up something I thought would help.

## Execution

### What's your tech stack?

A friend of mine told me I lean on `React` too much. 

So this is my way of showing him: "Oh yeah? NO I DON'T."

This directory is deliberately as simple and lightweight as possible.

`Vanilla JS`, `Bootstrap`, and `HTML`. 

The data is hosted in the site itself.

Because if someone else gets access to it, and makes another similar website...good. More ways this can reach people. 


## Where'd you get your data?

If you take away anything from this readme, it should be this: I did NOT assemble this data myself!

That hard work was done by members of Brooklyn Shows Love, and some other community aid organizations around the city.

You should donate to them!

## Clone this app!

If you have ideas to improve BSL, by all means, fork the repo.

If you want to work with a local copy, doing so couldn't be simpler. Just clone the repo onto your local machine, and get typin'.

If, however, you prefer to just monkey around with the data, I have you covered.

- As a <a href = "https://github.com/seinwave/bsl-resources/blob/ad7493184a8a3286922473f4c7468283ed94a2c5/data/nyc-resources.json">JSON.</a>
- AS a <a href = "data/nyc-resources.csv">CSV.</a>

All I ask is that you please attribute the data to Brooklyn Shows Love.

Enjoy!
